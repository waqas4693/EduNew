# AddAssessment Component Documentation

## Overview
This is a refactored and compartmentalized version of the original `AddAssessment.jsx` component. The component has been broken down into smaller, focused components and custom hooks for better maintainability, reusability, and testability.

## Structure

## Usage

### Using the New Component
```jsx
import AddAssessment from './components/forms/AddAssessment'

// The component can be used as a drop-in replacement
function App() {
  return <AddAssessment />
}
```

### Switching Between Old and New
To use the original component:
```jsx
import AddAssessment from './components/forms/AddAssessment.jsx'
```

To use the refactored component:
```jsx
import AddAssessment from './components/forms/AddAssessment'
```

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Separation of Concerns**
- **Form State**: Managed by `useAssessmentForm`
- **API Operations**: Handled by `useAssessmentAPI`
- **Data Hierarchies**: Managed by `useHierarchyData`
- **MCQ Logic**: Isolated in `useMCQManagement`
- **Validation**: Centralized in `useFormValidation`

### ðŸ”„ **Reusable Components**
- All form components are reusable across other assessment forms
- UI components follow consistent styling patterns
- Selectors can be used in other parts of the application

### ðŸ§ª **Testability**
- Small, focused components are easier to unit test
- Custom hooks can be tested independently
- Utility functions have clear inputs and outputs

### ðŸ“± **Maintainability**
- Each file has a single responsibility
- Clear component boundaries
- Consistent naming conventions

## Benefits Over Original

1. **Reduced Complexity**: Main component is only 80 lines vs 1344 lines
2. **Better Error Handling**: Centralized error management
3. **Improved Performance**: Smaller component bundles
4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Easier to locate and modify functionality
5. **Code Reusability**: Components can be reused in other assessment forms

## Migration Notes

- The original `AddAssessment.jsx` file remains untouched
- All functionality is preserved in the new structure
- The API remains the same - it's a drop-in replacement
- PropTypes are included for better development experience

## Future Enhancements

- Add unit tests for all components and hooks
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling
- Add internationalization support
- Consider adding Storybook stories for component documentation
