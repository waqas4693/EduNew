# MCQ Progress Duplicate Fix

## Problem
The MCQ progress percentage was exceeding 100% (e.g., 102%, 107%) due to duplicate MCQ progress entries being created in the database.

## Root Cause
1. **Backend Issue**: The `updateProgress` function in `studentProgress.js` was using `$push` instead of `$addToSet` for MCQ progress entries, allowing duplicate entries for the same resource.
2. **Frontend Issue**: The duplicate prevention logic in `LearnerFrame.jsx` was preventing re-attempts but not preventing duplicate completed entries.
3. **Calculation Issue**: The progress calculation was counting all completed entries instead of unique completed MCQs.

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes (`backend/controllers/studentProgress.js`)
1. **Duplicate Prevention**: Before adding a new MCQ progress entry, remove any existing entry for the same resource using `$pull`.
2. **Unique Counting**: Use `Set` to count unique completed MCQs instead of all completed entries.
3. **Safety Check**: Ensure progress percentage never exceeds 100%.

### Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/components/app-components/LearnerFrame.jsx`)
1. **Improved Duplicate Check**: Only prevent submissions if MCQ is already completed, not just attempted.
2. **Better Logic**: Allow re-attempts but prevent duplicate completed entries.

### Model Changes (`backend/models/studentProgress.js`)
1. **Consistent Calculation**: Updated `updateProgressPercentages` method to use the same unique counting logic.

## Database Cleanup

### Cleanup Script (`backend/scripts/cleanup-duplicate-mcq-progress.js`)
A comprehensive script that:
1. Identifies and removes duplicate MCQ progress entries
2. Keeps the most recent/complete entry for each resource
3. Recalculates all progress percentages
4. Verifies no percentages exceed 100%

### Running the Cleanup
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run the cleanup script
npm run cleanup:mcq

# Get help
npm run cleanup:mcq:help
```

## Testing the Fix

### Before Running Cleanup
1. Check for records with progress > 100%:
```javascript
db.studentprogresses.find({
  $or: [
    { mcqProgressPercentage: { $gt: 100 } },
    { resourceProgressPercentage: { $gt: 100 } }
  ]
})
```

### After Running Cleanup
1. Verify no progress percentages exceed 100%
2. Test MCQ completion flow
3. Verify progress calculations are accurate

## Key Improvements

1. **No More Duplicates**: MCQ progress entries are now unique per resource
2. **Accurate Percentages**: Progress percentages will never exceed 100%
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced database size by removing duplicates
4. **Consistent Logic**: Frontend and backend use the same duplicate prevention logic
5. **Data Integrity**: Existing data is cleaned up and recalculated

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/controllers/studentProgress.js` - Fixed duplicate prevention and calculation logic
- `backend/models/studentProgress.js` - Updated progress calculation method
- `backend/scripts/cleanup-duplicate-mcq-progress.js` - New cleanup script
- `backend/package.json` - Added cleanup script command

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/components/app-components/LearnerFrame.jsx` - Improved duplicate prevention logic
- `frontend/src/hooks/useProgress.js` - Enhanced MCQ update handling

## Monitoring

After implementing this fix, monitor:
1. MCQ progress percentages stay within 0-100% range
2. No duplicate MCQ progress entries are created
3. Progress calculations are accurate
4. Student experience is not affected by the changes

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the changes can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting the modified files to their previous state
2. Running the cleanup script to fix any data inconsistencies
3. Monitoring the system for stability
